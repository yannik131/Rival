 This is how long it takes me and my friends to run our standard routes. (Tim is doing it, I'm talking to a pretty girl). Tim is improving, I'm too constant. (Tim falls down on the ground and barely manages to press stop before passing out.) I should try to get faster.
 This is how long me and my sister brush our teeth in the morning and at night. I'm barely scratching the minimum in the morning, but at least I'm better than my sister.

//AVPlayer (Video) and AVAudioPlayer (Audio) take URLS instead of Bytestreams. I'm not sure if its feasible to load whole videos to the ram just to avoid reloading them. For now, everything is loaded live from the disk.
